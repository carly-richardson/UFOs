# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Create a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings
### Allow users to filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

## Results
The webpage can now be used to filter the UFO sightings data by date, city, state, country and/or shape.

To filter the data:
- You enter a date, city, state, country, and/or shape in the input box
- You can click anywhere on the page or click enter to filter the table
- When you clear the input box, the table will revert back to all the data

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is their is not a lot of data to filter. The data file only has sightings from 1/1/2010 through 1/13/2010. It also only includes sightings from the US. To further develop the webpage, I would include data from a larger date range and all over the World.
