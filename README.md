# UFO Sightings with JavaScript
## Overview
- Create a webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings
- The data can be filtered on multiple criteria

## Results
The webpage can now be used to filter the UFO sightings data by date, city, state, country and/or shape.

To filter the data:
  1. Enter a date, city, state, country, and/or shape in the input box.
  2. Click anywhere outside the input box with your mouse, or click enter on your keyboard.
  3. Clear the input box to revert back to the unfiltered table.

In the image above, the date is filtered to "1/1/2010" and the shape is filtered to "light".

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is their is not a lot of data to filter. The data file only has sightings from 1/1/2010 through 1/13/2010. It also only includes sightings from the US. To further develop the webpage, I would include data from a larger date range and all over the World.
